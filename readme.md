# DGNAP
 Distributed training based graph neural predictor with progressive search space prunning.


This code snippet is part of a GNAS project that aims to provide code assistance to developers. The code imports various libraries and modules, including os, time, argparse, and torch. It then defines a main function that takes in arguments such as dataset, type_task, search_space_name, sp_reduce, search_metric, best_search_metric_rule, predictor, predictor_criterion, and nb_gpu.

The main function sets up a process group using dist.init_process_group, initializes the random seed, and sets up the configuration file using the add_config function. The code then loads the dataset using the get_dataset function and creates an e_search_space using the create_e_search_space function.

The code then creates a performance_records_path using the get_performance_distributions function and stores the search results in a TopK_final variable. The search_start variable is set to the current time, and the dataset is loaded. The dataset_time_cost is calculated and added to the configuration file using the add_config function.

The code then calls the get_prediction function to retrieve the top-k search results, decodes the options using the option_decoder variable, and stores the results in a performance_records_path directory. The best_model is then retrieved using the get_best_model function, and the search_time is calculated.

The total_search_time is calculated and added to the configuration file, and the performance is written to a file using the write_results function. The Generate_time_cost function is then called to generate a time cost report.

The code also uses the accelerate library, which is a high-performance library for PyTorch that provides easy access to multiple GPUs and distributed training. The accelerate library is used to make search space reduction, which is a process of reducing the size of the search space to make it more manageable and efficient.

Search space reduction can be done using various techniques, such as pruning, which removes unnecessary options from the search space, and Bayesian optimization, which uses probability distributions to guide the search process. In this code snippet, the search_space_reduction_strategy argument in the main function is set to "shapley_values", which means that Shapley values are being used for search space reduction.

Shapley values are a mathematical tool used to divide up a group's contribution to a joint outcome. In the context of machine learning, Shapley values can be used to measure the contribution of each option in the search space to the overall performance of the model. By using Shapley values, the search space can be reduced to only the options that are most likely to contribute to the best model performance.

Overall, the code snippet you provided is part of a machine learning project that aims to provide code assistance to developers by using search space reduction and other techniques.
